# README

The basic functional features we want are as follows:

    Allow users to share and view links
    Allow users to sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out
    Allow signed-in users to submit and edit links
    Allow signed-in users to upvote or downvote links
    Allow signed-in users to comment on submitted links

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
